Introduction
====================
The portal is built on Wordpress (http://wordpress.org), a free, mature, and open CMS built with PHP on a SQL database. This is currently running in a multisite environment comprised of five sites:

1. *Main Landing Page* (http://portal.clevelandfoodbank.org/)
2. *Agency Portal* (http://portal.clevelandfoodbank.org/agency/)
3. *Programs Portal* (http://portal.clevelandfoodbank.org/programs/)
4. *Board Portal* (http://portal.clevelandfoodbank.org/board/)
5. *Employee Landing Page* (for the breakroom) (http://portal.clevelandfoodbank.org/employee/)

Hosting
=========================
- Our webhost is Bluehost (http://bluehost.com). We have a shared hosting plan, which has scaled well so far. 
- Neil and Phil have the account into for our hosting account and can access the cPanel. Hard coded DB edits can be done through PHPmyadmin in the cPanel. 
- You can check Bluehost's status by visiting their status page: (https://www.bluehost.com/cgi/serverstatus/) or twitter: (https://twitter.com/bluehostsupport)

General Wordpress Usage
=========================
####Posts
